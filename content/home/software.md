<b>JMbayes2</b> is an R-package that was co-developed by Prof. [Dimitris Rizopoulos](https://www.drizopoulos.com), me, and [Pedro M. Afonso](https://www.pafonso.com/)

The package <b>JMbayes2</b> fits joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data. It can accommodate multiple longitudinal outcomes of different type (e.g., continuous, dichotomous, ordinal, counts), and assuming different distributions, i.e., Gaussian, Studentâ€™s-t, Gamma, Beta, unit Lindley, censored Normal, Binomial, Poisson, Negative Binomial, and Beta-Binomial. For the event time process, right, left and interval censored data can be handled, while competing risks and multi-state processes are also covered.

<b>JMbayes2</b> fits joint models using Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms implemented in C++. Besides the main modeling function, the package also provides a number of functions to summarize and visualize the results.
