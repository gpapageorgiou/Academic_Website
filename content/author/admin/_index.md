I am currently working towards my PhD degree at the Department of Biostatistics and the Department of Thorax Surgery at the <span style = 'font-weight: bold'>E</span>rasmus <span style = 'font-weight: bold'>U</span>niversity <span style = 'font-weight: bold'>M</span>edical <span style = 'font-weight: bold'>C</span>enter under the supervision of Prof. [Dimitris Rizopoulos](https://www.drizopoulos.com), Prof. [Johanna J. M. Takkenberg](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Johanna_Takkenberg) and Dr. [Mostafa M. Mokhles](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mostafa_Mokhles). 

My research mainly focuses on extensions of Joint Models for longitudinal and time-to-event data. More specifically, I am working on the development of joint models that can incorporate intermediate events and time-varying treatments during follow-up as well as the development of individualized dynamic prediction tools which are adaptive to future changes regarding the occurrence of intermediate events or/and treatment changes.
