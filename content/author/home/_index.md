As a post-doctoral researcher at Erasmus MC my main focus is on the development of novel methodology for the joint modeling of longitudinal & time-to-event data. More specifically, during the course of my PhD at the Department of Biostatistics and the Department of Thorax Surgery at the <span style = 'font-weight: bold'>E</span>rasmus <span style = 'font-weight: bold'>U</span>niversity <span style = 'font-weight: bold'>M</span>edical <span style = 'font-weight: bold'>C</span>enter I worked on the development of joint models that can incorporate intermediate events (such as treatment changes, side-effects etc.) and time-varying treatments during follow-up as well as the development of individualized dynamic prediction tools which are adaptive to future changes regarding the occurrence of intermediate events or/and treatment changes. This work was done under the supervision of Prof. [Dimitris Rizopoulos](https://www.drizopoulos.com), Prof. [Johanna J. M. Takkenberg](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Johanna_Takkenberg) and Dr. [Mostafa M. Mokhles](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mostafa_Mokhles). Currently, I continue my research and I am focusing on joint modeling of multiple longitudinal and multi-state processes. I also work closely with Prof. [Dimitris Rizopoulos](https://www.drizopoulos.com) and [Pedro M. Afonso](https://www.pafonso.com/) in the development of R package [JMbayes2](https://drizopoulos.github.io/JMbayes2/)

Apart from research, I also work as a consultant and teaching assistant for the Department of Biostatistics. 
As a consultant, I provide advice on a broad range of statistical, study design, statistical software and methodological questions for various departments of Erasmus MC via the Consultation centre for Patient-Oriented research (CPO). This often leads to extended collaborations and deeper involvement in research projects.        

As of mid-2019, I am also glad to be part of the NIHES Innovation Team. My role is to support teachers in developing online versions for their courses. Our goal is to expand the overall educational experience for the students by exploiting the flexibility, interactivity and creativity of state-of-the-art e-learning tools. 

At the beginning of 2021, I was glad to become part of [CBG-MEB](https://english.cbg-meb.nl/) as a methodology assessor.
