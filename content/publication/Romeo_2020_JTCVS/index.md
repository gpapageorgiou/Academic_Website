# Abstract.
abstract = "<b>Background</b> <br> There is very limited published evidence about the influence of pregnancy on allograft durability in right ventricular outflow tract position. We present the first study using mixed and joint modeling. <br><b>Methods</b> <br> This retrospective study compared clinical and valve related outcomes of all consecutive female hospital survivors in their fertile life phase (18-50 years) based on pregnancy. Serial echocardiographic measurements of pulmonary gradient and regurgitation were analyzed for their association with valve replacement using joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data. Occurrence of first pregnancy was included as a time-dependent intermediate event in both the longitudinal and survival analyses of the joint model to assess its impact on the hemodynamic and clinical outcome. <br><b>Results</b> <br> In total, 196 consecutive women in their fertile life-phase with an allograft were included. Complete information of 176 (90%) allografts in 165 women was available, including 1395 echocardiograms. Of these women, 51 (30.9%) women had 84 completed pregnancies at an average age of 29.1 ± 3.9 (SD) years; 8.1 ± 6.1 years since allograft implantation. Tetralogy of Fallot was the most common diagnosis in both groups. After a mean follow-up of 15.2 years (range 0.1-30), 7 (13.7%) parous women underwent valve replacement versus 20 (17.5%) nulliparous women. During this follow-up, the mean allograft gradient in parous (24.2 mm Hg) and nulliparous (21.0 mm Hg) women was comparable ( P = .225). A 1-mm Hg increase in pulmonary gradient increased the instantaneous risk of pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) by a ratio of 1.051 ( P < .001), regardless of pregnancy. Similarly, development of moderate or severe regurgitation increased the risk of PVR ( P = .038), regardless of pregnancy. Pregnancy was not associated with a change in the allograft gradient ( P = .258), regurgitation grade ( P = .774), or hazard of PVR ( P = .796) during follow-up. <br><b>Conclusions</b> <br> Pregnancy is not associated with impaired allograft durability in women with good cardiac health."
