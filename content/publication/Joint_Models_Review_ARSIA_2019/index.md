# Abstract.
abstract = "In this review, we present an overview of joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data. We introduce a generalized formulation for the joint model that incorporates multiple longitudinal outcomes of varying types. We focus on extensions for the parametrization of the association structure that links the longitudinal and time-to-event outcomes, estimation techniques, and dynamic predictions. We also outline the software available for the application of these models."
